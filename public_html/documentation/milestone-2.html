    About Me: I am creating a one page website for my personal art; primarily a portfolio of visual art and silver work. At the top of the page will be my name in large font and an image that I feel encapsulates me and/or my art. I will write a brief description of myself with an informal artist's statement.
</p>
<p>
    Gallery: Underneath the About Me Section will be a small gallery of my visual art, including three older pieces that are sold or gone, and three available pieces. I will do the same for my silver work. This will allow me to exhibit my finest pieces, whether or not they are currently for sale.
</p>

<p>
    Contact: This will be one line at the bottom of the site with my e-mail address and a link to my instagram profile.
