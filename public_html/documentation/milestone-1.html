<h1>
    PWP Milestone 1
</h1>

<h2>
    Purpose:
</h2>

    <p>
        I would like my Personal Website Project to exemplify my skills/work as an artist and a silversmith, and
        provide a platform through which people can contact me to purchase or commission a piece. I will have a
        gallery of past pieces, as well as a section of currently available works for people to browse. I want the website
        to provide a simple form through which interested customers can contact me regarding interest in purchasing
        an art piece, or hiring me for a commissioned project.
    </p>

<h2>
    Audience:
</h2>
    <p>
        My website will be viewed by people who are interested in viewing my art, purchasing my art, or hiring me
        for a commissioned piece. These could be customers, or gallery owners/curators who are looking for
        artists to show in their galleries. The site will be designed for people who value aesthetics and beauty, and who are
        interested in seeing or learning more about my style of art. It will cater to potential customers who
        are interested in purchasing art from me.
    </p>

<h2>
   Goal:
</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my website is to be an online gallery through which potential customers (or galleries who
        are looking to showcase artists) can see my art and then inquire any interests they may have. By being able
        to reach people on a digital platform that is more professional than instagram, I hope to increase sales of my
        art, as well as find a gallery in which I can show my work.
    </p>
