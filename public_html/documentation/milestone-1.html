<h1>
    PWP Milestone 1

<h2>
    Purpose:
</h2>

    <p>
        I would like my Personal Website Project to exemplify my skills/work as an artist and a silversmith, and
        provide a platform through which people can contact me to purchase or commission a piece. I will have a
        gallery of past pieces, as well as a section of currently available works for people to browse. I want the website
        to provide a simple form through which interested customers can contact me regarding interest in purchasing
        an art piece, or hiring me for a commissioned project.
    </p>

<h2>
    Audience:
</h2>
    <p>
        My website will be viewed by people who are interested in viewing my art, purchasing my art, or hiring me
        for a commissioned piece. These could be customers, or gallery owners/curators who are looking for
        artists to show in their galleries. The site will be designed for people who value aesthetics and beauty, and who are
        interested in seeing or learning more about my style of art. It will cater to potential customers who
        are interested in purchasing art from me.
    </p>

<h2>
   Goal:
</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my website is to be an online gallery through which potential customers (or galleries who
        are looking to showcase artists) can see my art and then inquire any interests they may have. By being able
        to reach people on a digital platform that is more professional than instagram, I hope to increase sales of my
        art, as well as find a gallery in which I can show my work.

<h2>
    Persona:
</h2>

    <p>
        Name: Gloria Divine
    </p>

    <p>
        Age: 62
    </p>

    <p>
        Profession: Curator at a well known gallery that showcases both fine and folk art, by primarily local artists.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technology: Gloria uses a 2022 14" display MacBook Pro both at the gallery and at home. She also has an i-pad that she uses when traveling, and has an i-phone 10 with unlimited data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Attitudes and Behaviors: Gloria has been an art curator for 30 years, and has a knack for finding artists whom work she knows she can sell. She works on commission, so she wants any time that she spends looking for new artists to pay off. She is not perusing for enjoyment, she is doing business. She will often search social media, such as instagram, for popular artists and then look for a link to their personal website. Here she is looking for a professional portfolio as well as contact information. She sees the website as an important first impression of the artist and it can sway her interest one way or another.

    </p>

    <p>
        Frustrations and Needs: Gloria is looking for well organized, professional, and aesthetically pleasing websites when she is seeking new artists. She is frustrated by poorly organized sites, and especially those who do not offer simple and accessible contact information. She wants to be able to view an artists content via her laptop or a phone, since she is always seeking new talent yet not always at a computer. She is frustrated by artists who do not have an organized portfolio, with categories like "previous" or "available" works.
    </p>

    <p>
        Goals: Gloria's goal is to find available art collections by local artists that she thinks will sell in the gallery that she curates. Her goal is to make money by choosing the right art to showcase.
    </p>

    <p>
        User Story: As a casual but very competent user, I want to be able to see an artists work/style/self-brand and professionalism by viewing their website, and then be able to contact them easily if I am interested in representing them in my gallery.
