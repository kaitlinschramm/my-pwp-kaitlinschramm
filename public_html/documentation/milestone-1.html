<h1>
    PWP Milestone 1
</h1>

<h2>
    Purpose:
</h2>

    <p>
        I would like my Personal Website Project to exemplify my skills/work as an artist and a silversmith, and
        provide a platform through which people can contact me to purchase or commission a piece. I will have a
        gallery of past pieces, as well as a section of currently available works for people to browse. I want the website
        to provide a simple form through which interested customers can contact me regarding interest in purchasing
        an art piece, or hiring me for a commissioned project.
    </p>

<h2>
    Audience:
</h2>
    <p>
        My website will be viewed by people who are interested in viewing my art, purchasing my art, or hiring me
        for a commissioned piece. These could be customers, or gallery owners/curators who are looking for
        artists to show in their galleries. The site will be designed for people who value aesthetics and beauty, and who are
        interested in seeing or learning more about my style of art. It will cater to potential customers who
        are interested in purchasing art from me.
    </p>

<h2>
   Goal:
</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my website is to be an online gallery through which potential customers (or galleries who
        are looking to showcase artists) can see my art and then inquire any interests they may have. By being able
        to reach people on a digital platform that is more professional than instagram, I hope to increase sales of my
        art, as well as find a gallery in which I can show my work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Attitudes and Behaviors: Gloria has been an art curator for 30 years, and has a knack for finding
        artists whom work she knows she can sell. She works on commission, so she wants any time that she spends
        looking for new artists to pay off. She is not perusing for enjoyment, she is doing business.

//Persona
Name: David B. McCracken
Age: 34

Profession: Co-Founder and CTO of FashionGun.com, a startup that is looking to hire a full-time, in-house Front-End Web Developer. They have just received their first round of VC seed funding. Their product is an online collaboration and project management tool marketed to the fashion industry.

Technology: Mac power user. Uses a Mac Pro Tower with 2 30” cinema displays while in the office, a MacBook Pro laptop at home, and an iPhone 7 plus with an unlimited 4G data connection.

Attitudes and Behaviors: Short on time, overworked, and has a full social schedule in addition. David will not spend more than 3 minutes max looking at anyone’s portfolio site, and only about 30 seconds on a resume. David is a huge social media user, and seeks potential candidates through tech and fashion community networking events, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

Frustrations and Needs: David needs to hire someone with 5-7 years of development experience who is willing to start at a competitive entry-level salary, to start. David is also looking for someone who is a good personality and cultural fit for FashionGun as well. FashionGun is still small, and can only offer limited benefits at this time, but will include equity options as part of the compensation package. Because David is looking to hire within a very competitive urban market, he is flooded with candidates but is having a hard time finding someone with the right combination of talent, experience, and personality who is willing to accept a slightly lower salary and limited benefits. He must hire within 2 weeks.

Goals: David is only concerned with one thing: Is this person a potential candidate for the FashionGun Web Dev position? Can David, within 3 minutes max, determine whether this person is worthy of a preliminary phone screen regarding the job? David doesn't like to waste time. David needs to know via a very fast interaction with the site whether or not this potential candidate has the minimum qualifications to warrant a call.

User Story: As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a candidate for the mid-level Front End Web Developer position.
